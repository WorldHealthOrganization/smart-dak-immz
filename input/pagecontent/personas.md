A persona is a depiction of a relevant stakeholder, or end user, of the system.
Although the specific roles and demographic profiles of the personas will vary depending on the setting, generic personas are based on WHO core competencies and credentials of different health worker personas.

### Targeted generic personas

 The targeted personas for the WHO DAK for immunizations are health workers operating in care settings that are able to provide the required essential interventions for immunization delivery. The key competences of health workers, community health workers and EPI managers are defined by WHO in the Table 2 of the DAK.

### Related personas
In addition to the targeted personas detailed in Table 2, there may be value in exploring other health worker occupational groups and stakeholders within the context of immunization services, such as caregiver or child. However, these were not identified as the central personas for the data and decision-support content detailed in this DAK. Additional related personas are listed in the Table 3 of the DAK.
